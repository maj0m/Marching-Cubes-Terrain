# (08.16) Update: Erosion on the GPU!
- Changed the way erosion is performed: instead of simulating particles on the cpu, it is now done in parallel on the GPU using a compute shader making it blazingly fast (real time!!!).
Before / After erosion:

# (08.04) Update:  GLFW Integration, GUI Support with ImGui, Hydraulic Erosion, and Height-based Coloring Refactor Ahead!

- Added hydraulic erosion (Particle simulation, implementation is based on
https://nickmcd.me/2020/04/10/simple-particle-based-hydraulic-erosion/)
- Switched graphics libraries and reordered the file structure to be more intuitive
- Various optimizations and improvements for better maintainability
- Removed height-based coloring to give space for a more sophisticated biome system
- Added a GUI

# (07.24) Update: Various shader improvements & dynamic foam where land meets water
I temporarily disabled fog and atmosphere in this update to rework them later.
Coming up: Procedural clouds with gpu instancing
